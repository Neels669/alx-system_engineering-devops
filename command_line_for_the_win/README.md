**Using SFTP to Transfer Files**

* Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine. Used CMD.

* Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. You will need the hostname, username, and password provided to you for the sandbox environment.

* Once connected, navigate to the directory where you want to upload the screenshots, it should work the same way as sandbox.

* Use the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment. Example: 
put C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\2-next_9_tasks.png

* Confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.

* Once the screenshots are transferred, you can proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub.
